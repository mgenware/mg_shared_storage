## Stability

The latest version is a Beta release, which means all these APIs can change over a short period of time without prior notice.

So, please be aware that this is plugin is not intended for production usage yet, since the API is currently in development.

## Features

Current supported features are detailed below.

### Summary

- [x] Read and write to files.
- [x] Pick files using a filter (e.g image/png).
- [x] Single or multiple file picks.
- [x] Picking directories.
- [x] Load file data immediately into memory (Uint8List) if needed.
- [x] Delete files/directories.
- [x] Getting file thumbnails as `Image.memory` bytes (Uint8List).
- [x] Launch file with third apps.
- [x] Request install APKs.
- [x] List directory contents recursively (aka file-explorer like experience).

### Detailed

- [x] **No runtime permissions are required**, this package doesn't rely on `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` or any other runtime permission, only normal permissions (`READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`, `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`) are implicitly used and added to your Android project.
- [x] Read file content as Future.
- [ ] Read file content as Stream (planned).
- [x] Get file's thumbnail (APK file icons are also supported but not recommended due it's poor performance limited by SAF and PackageManager API).
- [x] Request install apk (requires `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGE` permission and it's entirely optional).
- [x] Open and persist folders granted by the user ("Select folder" use-case).
- [x] Open and persist files granted by the user ("Select file" use-case).
- [x] Different default type filtering (media, image, video, audio or any).
- [x] List files inside a folder with Streams.
- [x] Copy file.
- [x] Open file with third-party apps (aka "Open with" use-case).
- [x] Folders and files granted can be persisted across device reboots (optional).
- [x] Delete file.
- [x] Delete folder.
- [x] Edit file contents.
- [ ] Edit file contents through lazy streams (planned).
- [x] Move file (it's a copy + delete).

## Plugin

This plugin include **partial** support for the following APIs:

### Partial Support for [Environment](./Usage/Environment.md)

Mirror API from [Environment](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Environment)

```dart
import 'package:shared_storage/environment.dart' as environment;
```

### Partial Support for [Media Store](./Usage/Media%20Store.md)

Mirror API from [MediaStore provider](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/MediaStore)

```dart
import 'package:shared_storage/media_store.dart' as mediastore;
```

### Partial Support for [Storage Access Framework](./Usage/Storage%20Access%20Framework.md)

Mirror API from [Storage Access Framework](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider)

```dart
import 'package:shared_storage/saf.dart' as saf;
```

All these APIs are module based, which means they are implemented separadely and so you need to import those you want use.

> To request support for some API that is not currently included open a issue explaining your usecase and the API you want to make available, the same applies for new methods or activities for the current APIs.

## Android APIs

Most Flutter plugins use Android API's under the hood. So this plugin does the same, and to call native Android storage APIs the following API's are being used:

[`ðŸ”—android.os.Environment`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Environment#summary) [`ðŸ”—android.provider.MediaStore`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/MediaStore#summary) [`ðŸ”—android.provider.DocumentsProvider`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider)
